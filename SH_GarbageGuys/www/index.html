    <p>Using this service has MANY benefits! Aside from cleaning the environment that you live in, the cleaners from GarbageGuys gain valuable volunteer experience that can be applied to their resume THAT DAY! This is especially valuable to teenagers, Many of whom are required to have accumulated so many hours of community service before they can graduate. Also valuable to children. The earlier that we can teach our children, and the future generation about the health of the planet, The earlier we will see results in our local communities. With enough participation, Future projects can be initiated to clean our forests, Clean our oceans, And ultimately, CLEAN OUR LIVES! It is never to early to change, and, it is never wrong to do the right thing! </p>

    <p>The most exciting part! GarbageGuys is completely non for profit!</p>
    <p>After expenses, ALL money raised by contributors, will be invested to pay for the development and testing of future technologies that also contribute to Cleaning our planet, with a support on green technologies and improving mankind. </p>
